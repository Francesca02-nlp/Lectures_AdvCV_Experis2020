*don't worry. This is **not** an exam! it's mandatory and only for you!*

*You can see 2 notebooks!*

- base_pytorch_AE.ipynb : *it's just an introduction to pytorch as framework so that you can see how to write a model not in tf.keras. This will be usefull for you in NLP courses....*

- exam_pruning.ipynb : *this is the fake exam. Inside you'll find lots of information . . . This is a REAL EXAMPLE from paper to CODE. **Tips** : take your time and (as you can) enjoy it ;)*
